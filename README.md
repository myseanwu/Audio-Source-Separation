## Audio Source Separation: Music Feature Extraction

### Abstract

In this project, we would like to explore the music separation using the feature extraction and the deep learning model. We transformed the audio signals to spectrograms and mel spectrograms, running through bidirectional LSTM models with fully connected layers to output the estimates of vocals. After our training and validation, we could have similar or a bit better performance on separated vocals as opposed to the baseline model, which only used spectrogram as input.
